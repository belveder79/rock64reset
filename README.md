## Purpose

The main purpose of this board to act as a smart, programmable watchdog. It is meant to be programmed by developers or other experienced persons to overcome certain weird lockup problems for boards. We do not intend to supply a configurable user interface nor firmware for the regular consumer. Because every embedded board might have different requirements for proper reset or power-up, we rather provide the solution for the RockPro64 here as a blueprint.

---
## Temperature Sensor

The temperature sensor is isolated from the rest of the board to enable driving it from an external board with GPIO (e.g. RPi, OrangePi, RockPro64). This was designed in that way, because the ESP32 controlled board is not meant to watch the temperature or humidity, it should be a watchdog.

The sensor is a [Sensirion SHT31 sensor](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors/digital-humidity-sensors-for-various-applications/) which is accessed and controlled over I2C. Proper libraries can be found e.g. for the [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SHT31) implementation.

*Note: It is still possible to use the entire ESP32 circuit NOT as a watchdog, but rather as a Node-MCU with integrated temperature sensor. In order to make this possible, some resistors (R22-R24) need to be populated with 0 Ohm (or just shortcutted). This wires the SHT31 straight to the I2C bus on the ESP32.*

| GPIO (ESP32) | SHT31       |
| -------------|:-----------:|
| GPIO21 (SDA) | SDA         |
| GPIO22 (SCL) | SCL         |
| 3.3V   (VCC) | VCC         |

### Simple Python Script

If the temperature sensor is properly wired to the GPIO of the respective board, a simple python script largely taken from [here](http://www.pibits.net/code/raspberry-pi-sht31-sensor-example.php) can be used to query the temperature and humidity.

```python
import smbus
import time

# Get I2C bus
bus = smbus.SMBus(4)

# SHT31 address, 0x44(68)
bus.write_i2c_block_data(0x44, 0x2C, [0x06])

time.sleep(0.5)

# SHT31 address, 0x44(68)
# Read data back from 0x00(00), 6 bytes
# Temp MSB, Temp LSB, Temp CRC, Humididty MSB, Humidity LSB, Humidity CRC
data = bus.read_i2c_block_data(0x44, 0x00, 6)

# Convert the data
temp = data[0] * 256 + data[1]
cTemp = -45 + (175 * temp / 65535.0)
fTemp = -49 + (315 * temp / 65535.0)
humidity = 100 * (data[3] * 256 + data[4]) / 65535.0

# Output data to screen
print "Temperature in Celsius is : %.2f C" %cTemp
print "Temperature in Fahrenheit is : %.2f F" %fTemp
print "Relative Humidity is : %.2f %%RH" %humidity
```

Running the script should give something like:

```
root@vz:~# python sht31.py
Temperature in Celsius is : 29.28 C
Temperature in Fahrenheit is : 84.70 F
Relative Humidity is : 14.55 %RH
```

*Note: I2C bus 4 was used on the RockPro64 connecting Pins 27 and 28 as SDA and SCL.*

### Node-Red Integration

In order to use the temperature sensor in an easy way together with Node-Red, there is an implementation for a Node in the [node-red-contrib-sht31](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-sht31) package. The only requirement for configuration is to check for the correct I2C bus (and access rights).

![Node-Red Node](images/nodered.png "Node-Red Node")

The output of a query is a simple object containing temperature and humidity.

## Wiring

For wiring for example the RockPro64 correctly, the following setup is applied:

![RockPro64 Wiring](images/rockpro64.jpg "RockPro64 Wiring")

In more detail, the wiring in our case is (alternatives in brackets):

| GPIO (RockPro64) | Cable Color         | ESP32 Resetter                 |
| ---------------  |:-------------------:| :-----------------------------:|
| Pin 17 (Pin 1)   | violet (brown)      | VCC (SHT31)                    |
| Pin 16           | blue                | Heartbeat (J4 - GPIO16)        |
| Pin 8            | grey                | Power Status (J7 - GPIO17)     |
| Pin 20 (Pin 9)   | black (white)       | GND (SHT31)                    |
| Pin 27           | violet              | SDA (SHT31)                    |
| Pin 28           | white               | SCL (SHT31)                    |

While the color coding is not really optimal, it's a direct result of choosing a 40-pin ribbon cable from [Bewinner](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07P4LFM14/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and cutting out the relevant cables.

For the Reset and Power button to turn on/off or reset the RockPro64, we connect the following pins (note that on the RockPro64 these pins have to be assembled manually):

| RockPro64      | Cable Color   | ESP32 Resetter              |
| -------------- |:-------------:| :--------------------------:|
| Power          | blue          | PullDown (J3 - GPIO13)        |
| Reset          | orange        | PullDown (J2 - GPIO14)        |

**Warning! Don't connect those cables BEFORE flashing the ESP32 firmware. Because the ESP32 is pulling those pins down at boot time, your RockPro64 (or whatever) might not boot. ESP32 firmware needs to pull them up on startup in firmware (see [below](#inverted-logic))!**

## Heatbeat over GPIO

Obviously there are multiple different ways to interface the GPIO of a RockPro64 or RPi. We are using a Linux service driving a python script for that.

### Using Python on RockPro64

We are using ```python``` and the [GPIO library](https://github.com/ThroneVault/Rock64-R64.GPIO/) together with an according script to output a heartbeat on a particular GPIO with a 1 second interval. The according file ```heartbeat.py``` looks somewhat like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

# Clemens Arth, 2021, LGPLv3 License
# based on...
# Frank Mankel, 2018, LGPLv3 License
# Rock 64 GPIO Library for Python
# Thanks Allison! Thanks smartdave!

import R64.GPIO as GPIO
from time import sleep

print("Output Test R64.GPIO Module...")

# Set Variables -> in this case we are at
# pin 16, aka GPIO #36
# alternatively use pin 8, aka GPIO #148, but we use this for detecting power status
var_gpio_out = 36

# GPIO Setup
GPIO.setwarnings(True)
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.ROCK)
GPIO.setup(var_gpio_out, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.HIGH)       # Set up GPIO as an output, with an initial state of HIGH

# Test Output
print("")
print("Testing GPIO Input/Output:")

while True:
        var_gpio_state = GPIO.input(var_gpio_out)       # Return State of GPIO
        print("Output State: " + str(var_gpio_state))
        if var_gpio_state == 1:
                GPIO.output(var_gpio_out,0)                         # Set GPIO to LOW
                print("Turning off")              # Print results
        else:
                GPIO.output(var_gpio_out,1)                         # Set GPIO to LOW
                print("Turning on")
        sleep(1.0)
exit()
```

This sample is largely taken from [Frank Mankel's homepage](https://forum.frank-mankel.org/topic/292/rockpro64-rp64-gpio/6). The pinout configuration is like this for RockPro64:

![RockPro 64 Pinout](https://forum.frank-mankel.org/assets/uploads/files/1537460598918-rockpro64_gpio_reference-resized.png)

### Service File

The easiest way to get the heartbeat working is to install a file for ```systemd```. Here is an example script ```heartbeat.service``` that should go into ```/etc/systemd/system```:

```
[Unit]
Description=HeartBeatService
After=network.target

[Service]
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/<user>/heartbeat.py
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
KillMode=process
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Naturally, you can start the script from hand by using something like ```systemctl start heartbeat```. If you want to start it at every boot, you have to enable the service accordingly using ```systemctl enable heartbeat```.

## ESP32 Firmware

### Programming
For programming the ESP32, you need to press XP3, hold and press XP1 once, releasing XP3. This puts the ESP32 into programming mode. This should show something like

```
ets Jul 29 2019 12:21:46

rst:0x1 (POWERON_RESET),boot:0x7 (DOWNLOAD_BOOT(UART0/UART1/SDIO_REI_REO_V2))
waiting for download
```

### Example Watchdog watch script
The basic firmware does not enable BT or Wifi at all, as this is not needed. Here is a script to watch the heart beat of a device:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

#define BUTTONPIN 5
#define HEARTBEAT 16
#define RESETKEY 14
#define POWERKEY 13

bool in = false;
void IRAM_ATTR HandleButtonInterrupt() {
    Serial.println("Interrupt from Button!");
    if(!in)
    {
      // set 100ms reset...
      in = true;
      digitalWrite(RESETKEY, HIGH);
      delay(100);
      digitalWrite(RESETKEY, LOW);
      delay(400);
    }
    in = false;
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  // attach an interrupt to the middle button for fun...
  attachInterrupt(BUTTONPIN, HandleButtonInterrupt, FALLING);

  // define input heartbeat pin...
  pinMode(HEARTBEAT, INPUT);

  // define pulldowns to be up by default (inverted logic)
  pinMode(RESETKEY, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(POWERKEY, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(RESETKEY, LOW);
  digitalWrite(POWERKEY, LOW);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  while(true) {
    int val = digitalRead(HEARTBEAT);
    Serial.printf("Value is %d\n",val);
    delay(500);
  }
}
```
The script does only print the current heartbeat status to the serial. The middle button XP2 is programmed to pull the RESETKEY down for about 100ms. Because the interrupt is fired multiple times probably, the guard makes sure that it is only pulled down once within 500ms.

### Inverted Logic

The PullDown pins of the board protect both the ESP32 and the board to drive from high currents. As a side effect, the **logic is inverted**. In code, the PullDown pins must be pulled HIGH for them to pull to GND. In order to pull them up, one has to apply LOW.

## Standard ESP config interface

In order to configure standard settings, the ESP32 exposes a standard interface. The configuration can be loaded and saved and will sustain any power loss or restart. The default config values are uploaded along the file system and are listed in `config.json`. To reset the watchdog to its defaults without flashing the filesystem again, the flash button (XP3) for more than 5 seconds (see `Constants.h` file for defined period.)
